I took this class because I took creative coding 1 last semester and learned a bit on how to create a website but it was just basic stuff. I ended up making a couple pages but I never got them to look good so I'm hoping i can learn that skill here.
I want to learn how to add images well into a page. I want to learn how to make a free flowing page with videos and links. I want to learn how to decorate a page overall and make it look semi professional.
